## Nuxt Layer
To integrate our design system into your Nuxt project, simply extend the nuxt-digimarket-layer to your existing Nuxt<Badge size="small">3</Badge> project. For detailed instructions, please refer to the installation guide. We are actively working on this layer, and the completed sections will be available in the "Nuxt" section of our documentation.

## Nuxt E-Commerce App
We are currently developing a fully functional e-commerce application using the Nuxt layer of our design system. This app serves as a comprehensive demonstration of our design system's capabilities and can be used as a reference for building similar projects. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting development!
