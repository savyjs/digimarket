## Color Strategy

The digimarket kit includes a pre-defined color system for both light and dark modes.
We believe that it's best to set colors inside presets rather than using configuration options.
Trying to customize each element and component color through a complex configuration can be cumbersome and often disrupts the harmony and user experience.

Instead, we recommend defining a new preset for each theme if you need to change colors. 
While it is possible to modify some pre-defined colors like success, info, primary, and accent colors (although not recommended), overriding every color of every element through the configuration is not possible.

Colors play a crucial role in the overall user experience (UX).
